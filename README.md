## **Types of Learning**

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning utilizes labeled data to train models for tasks such as classification and regression.

- **Example:** Predicting house prices using historical data with known prices.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- **Example:** Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines labeled and unlabeled data to enhance model performance.

- **Example:** Training a model on a small set of labeled images and a large set of unlabeled images.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions based on rewards or penalties in an environment.

- **Example:** Teaching an agent to play a game by maximizing its score.

---

## **Data Splitting**

Data is typically divided into:

- **Training Set:** For model training.
- **Validation Set:** For tuning model parameters and selecting the best model.
- **Test Set:** For evaluating model performance on unseen data.

---

## **Descriptive Statistics**

Descriptive statistics provide insights into the main features of a dataset:

- **Mean (Arithmetic Mean):**
  ![Mean Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BMean%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum%20x_i%7D%7Bn%7D)
  where \( n \) is the number of data points, and \( x_i \) are the values.

- **Median:** The middle value in an ordered dataset, not influenced by outliers.

- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value.

- **Min and Max:** The smallest and largest values, respectively.

- **Variance:**
  ![Variance Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BVariance%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum%20%28x_i%20-%20%5Ctext%7BMean%7D%29%5E2%7D%7Bn-1%7D)
  
- **Standard Deviation:**
  ![Standard Deviation Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BStandard%20Deviation%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctext%7BVariance%7D%7D)

---

## **Outliers**

Outliers are data points significantly different from others. Their treatment depends on context:

- **Include Outliers:** If they provide valuable information.
- **Exclude Outliers:** If they are errors or distort results.

### Methods to Identify Outliers

- **Visual Inspection:** Use plots like box plots or scatter plots.

- **Statistical Methods:**
  - **Z-score:** Indicates how many standard deviations a point is from the mean.
    ![Z-score Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Z%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20-%20%5Cmu%7D%7B%5Csigma%7D)
    where \( x \) is the data point, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

  - **IQR (Interquartile Range):**
    ![IQR Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BIQR%7D%20%3D%20Q3%20-%20Q1)
    Outliers are points outside the range \([Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR, Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR]\), where \( Q1 \) and \( Q3 \) are the first and third quartiles.

---

## **Feature Scaling**

Feature scaling ensures that features contribute equally to the model. Common methods include:

- **Standard Scaling (Standardization):**
  ![Standard Scaling Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20-%20%5Cmu%7D%7B%5Csigma%7D)
  where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

- **Min-Max Scaling:**
  ![Min-Max Scaling Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_%7Bscaled%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20-%20x_%7Bmin%7D%7D%7Bx_%7Bmax%7D%20-%20x_%7Bmin%7D%7D)
  Scales features to a range, typically [0, 1].

- **Robust Scaling:**
  ![Robust Scaling Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x_%7Bscaled%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20-%20%5Ctext%7BMedian%7D%7D%7BIQR%7D)
  Uses median and interquartile range (IQR) to handle outliers.

## **Feature Selection**

Feature selection improves model performance by choosing relevant features:

- **Variance-based:** Remove features with low variance.
- **Correlation-based:** Remove features that are highly correlated to avoid redundancy.

---

## **Correlation vs. Causation**

- **Correlation:** Measures the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means both variables increase together, while a negative correlation means one increases as the other decreases.

  Correlation coefficient formula:
  ![Correlation Coefficient Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Ctext%7BCorrelation%20Coefficient%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BCov%28X%2C%20Y%29%7D%7B%5Csigma_X%20%5Csigma_Y%7D)
  where \( Cov(X, Y) \) is the covariance between \( X \) and \( Y \), and \( \sigma_X \) and \( \sigma_Y \) are their standard deviations.

- **Causation:** Indicates that one variable directly affects another. Correlation does not imply causation.

---

## **Normalization and Transformation**

- **Normalization:** Adjusts data to a specific range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

- **Power Transformation:** Helps stabilize variance and make the data more Gaussian-like, improving modeling performance.

---

## **Regression and Correlation**

- **Regression:** Predicts one variable based on another, quantifying the relationship between them.

- **Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables but does not imply causation.
