Types of learning

Supervised learning - labeled data
Unsupervised learning - unlabeled data
SemiSupervised learning - label and unlabeled data
Reinforcement learning - function is optimized by the reward [ajent] 

Split data
 - Test Set
 - Training Set
 - Validation Set
 
 
 mean is always favor to max value [extreme value]
 this can be verified by
 standard deviation - for extreme values standard deviation is high [square of variance cause this high deviation] 
 it is an average dispersion from the average
 
 
Do we need to remove outliers [based on the dataset]
	if your dataset is small you have an outliers.. if we gradually increase the dataset size.. this outliers might be an actual wanted data
	- we can verify with original population and come to a conclution if it is an actual outliers
	- inclue outliers
	- exclude outliers
