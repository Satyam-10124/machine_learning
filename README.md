## ### 1. Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning

Uses labeled data to train models. Examples include classification and regression tasks.

**Example:** Predicting house prices based on historical data with known prices.

### Unsupervised Learning

Uses unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings within the data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

**Example:** Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance.

**Example:** Using a small set of labeled images and a large set of unlabeled images to train an image classifier.

### Reinforcement Learning

Optimizes a function by receiving rewards or penalties based on actions taken in an environment.

**Example:** Training an agent to play a game by maximizing the cumulative score.

## ### 2. Data Splitting

To evaluate the performance of a machine learning model, data is typically split into:

- **Training Set:** Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set:** Used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.
- **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

---

## ### 3. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help summarize and describe the main features of a dataset:

- **Mean (Arithmetic Mean):** Average value.
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
  \]
  where \( n \) is the number of data points and \( x_i \) are the individual data points.

- **Median:** Middle value in an ordered dataset. Not affected by outliers.

- **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value in the dataset.

- **Min:** Smallest value in the dataset.

- **Max:** Largest value in the dataset.

- **Variance:** Measure of the spread of data points.
  \[
  \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2
  \]
  where \( \text{Mean} \) is the mean of the dataset.

- **Standard Deviation:** Square root of the variance. Measures dispersion.
  \[
  \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}}
  \]

---

## ### 4. Outliers

Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. Their treatment depends on the dataset:

- **Include Outliers:** If they provide valuable information.
- **Exclude Outliers:** If they distort analysis or predictions.

### Methods to Handle Outliers

- **Visual Inspection:** Use box plots or scatter plots to identify outliers.

- **Statistical Methods:** Identify outliers using Z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range).

  - **Z-score Method:**
    \[
    Z = \frac{x - \text{Mean}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}
    \]
    where \( x \) is the data point, and \( \text{Mean} \) and \( \text{Standard Deviation} \) are from the dataset.

  - **IQR Method:**
    \[
    \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
    \]
    Outliers are typically defined as data points outside \( [Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}, Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}] \), where \( Q1 \) and \( Q3 \) are the first and third quartiles.

---

## ### 5. Feature Scaling

Scaling ensures that features contribute equally to the model. Common methods include:

- **Standard Scaling (Standardization):** Adjusts features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  \[
  z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
  where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the feature.

- **Min-Max Scaling:** Scales features to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].
  \[
  x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x - x_{\text{min}}}{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}
  \]
  where \( x_{\text{min}} \) and \( x_{\text{max}} \) are the minimum and maximum values of the feature.

- **Robust Scaling:** Uses median and IQR to scale features, making it robust to outliers.
  \[
  x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x - \text{Median}}{\text{IQR}}
  \]
  where \( \text{Median} \) is the median of the feature and \( \text{IQR} \) is the interquartile range.

## ### 6. Feature Selection

Feature selection improves model performance and reduces overfitting:

- **Variance-based:** Remove features with low variance.

- **Correlation-based:** Remove highly correlated features.

---

## ### 7. Correlation vs. Causation

- **Correlation:** Measures the relationship between two variables. Positive correlation means both variables increase together, while negative correlation means one increases as the other decreases.
  \[
  \text{Correlation Coefficient} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
  \]
  where \( \text{Cov}(X, Y) \) is the covariance between \( X \) and \( Y \), and \( \sigma_X \) and \( \sigma_Y \) are the standard deviations of \( X \) and \( Y \).

- **Causation:** Indicates that one variable directly affects another. Correlation does not imply causation.

---

## ### 8. Normalization and Transformation

- **Normalization:** Scaling features to a range [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

- **Power Transformation:** Applies transformations to stabilize variance and make data more Gaussian-like.

---

## ### 9. Regression and Correlation

- **Regression:** Predicts the value of one variable based on another. Regression analysis quantifies the relationship between variables.

- **Correlation:** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables but does not imply causation.
