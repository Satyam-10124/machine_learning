Types of learning

Supervised learning - labeled data
Unsupervised learning - unlabeled data
SemiSupervised learning - label and unlabeled data
Reinforcement learning - function is optimized by the reward [ajent] 

Split data
 - Test Set
 - Training Set
 - Validation Set
 
 
 mean is always favor to max value [extreme value]
 this can be verified by
 standard deviation - for extreme values standard deviation is high [square of variance cause this high deviation] 
 it is an average dispersion from the average
 
 
Do we need to remove outliers [based on the dataset]
	if your dataset is small you have an outliers.. if we gradually increase the dataset size.. this outliers might be an actual wanted data
	- we can verify with original population and come to a conclution if it is an actual outliers
	- inclue outliers
	- exclude outliers

Data preperation is more important than Model training

Transformation
anomaly

Data:
    - Discriptive statistics
        - mean
        - median
        - min 
        - max
        - variance
        - standard deviation
    leads to sample space understanding
    corelation 

in stock market prediciton.. 

negative correlation if you have 2 stocks and these two are negatively correlated [ if one goes profit and other goes loos since they are negatively correlated ]


Feature selection

noramal distribution 
    has only two variables 
    easy to manuplace
    easy to understand
    have strong mathematical prof

Average tells truth..
